Overview


The Starbucks Capstone of the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree presents a true-to-life business problem. It simulates the data generated by customer transactions, the customers' demographic data, and the data about various offers presented to customers.


Motivation


Aside from the motivation of wanting to complete the capstone project for the Udacity Data Science Nano degree, I chose to work on this project because I enjoy working on business problems.

Files in the repo

Starbucks_Capstone_notebook.ipynb - this is the main notebook where work was done starting out. It includes a function that generates labels on the dataset and a classifier that tries to fit on the dataset and predict.  There are two versions. One on the master branch and one in the branch 'ult-wide'

Starbucks-Prophet- an alternative approach using Facebook's Prophet to predict how certain demographic groups will behave.

Dependencies
The main unusual dependency is Facebook’s prophet. (‘pip install fbprophet’)


Prophet requires that Pystan (‘pip install pystan’) be installed.


Beyond that it requires some elements pretty standard for Python/Data Science


numpy
pandas
Sklearn
Datetime
matplotlib
